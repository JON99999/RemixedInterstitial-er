When I direct the agent to "Check your work in github"...
1. go to https://github.com/JON99999/Interstitial-er/actions.
2. Parse to determine THE MOST RECENT release attempt.  
3. State the html link of the most recent release result (eg: https://github.com/JON99999/Interstitial-er/actions/runs/26407015838) at the start of your response.
4. Review that release action AND ONLY that release action.
5. Review it for any and all errors or issues noted. Explicitly state if you have or haven't been able to find the error message due to accessibility issues (such as being redirected to a login page or blocked by scraping limitations) when scraping.
6. Summarize those issues by row number they are mentioned on, with a brief description of what they mean, along with a brief description of possible solution paths.
7. SUGGEST, but DO NOT IMPLEMENT UNTIL I CONFIRM IN A NEW PROMPT, actions I should direct you to take to resolve these issues.
8. Never change the text of this prompt unless explicitly told to.
