# Suggestions & Architectural Notes

Based on your requirements, here are some professional recommendations and clarifications:

## 1. Storage Choice (Google Drive vs. Local)
- **Current Implementation**: The app uses local JSON files on the server (`data/schedules.json` and `data/logs.json`). 
- **Recommendation**: To truly fulfill the "portable on Google Drive" requirement, you could map the `data/` directory to a synced Google Drive folder on your host machine. Alternatively, using the Google Drive API would allow the app to read/write directly to Drive without needing local file system syncing.

## 2. Audio "Ready-to-Play" (Caching)
- **Current Implementation**: The app attempts to play the URL directly.
- **Recommendation**: For "instant" playback, we should use the Web Audio API to pre-fetch (fetch + decodeBuffer) mp3s that are scheduled within the next 10 minutes. This ensures no lag when the play button is clicked.

## 3. Log Strategy
- **Security**: As you noted, security is a secondary concern here. However, storing logs as a simple JSON array is fine for moderate usage. If logs grow to tens of thousands of entries, consider a daily log file (e.g., `logs-2023-10-27.json`) to keep load times fast.

## 4. Time Sync
- **Warning**: Relying on the user's browser clock might be problematic if their system clock is off. The app should ideally sync its "Internal Time" with the server time on load.

## 5. File Selection UI
- **Model**: For the MP3 link selector, a simple "File Explorer" view of the `data/mp3s` folder is implemented. Users can also type full URLs for external resources.

## 6. Portability (Resolved in v0.4)
- **Status**: Completed. The application has been fully integrated into an Electron desktop container (supporting MacOS arm64, MacOS Intel, and Windows 10/11) leveraging a bundled Node.js Express backend and localized `userData` persistent directories. You can run the application directly as a standalone local executable.
