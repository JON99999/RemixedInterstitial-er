# Environment Guidelines

This application is primarily a **Desktop Application** built with Electron and Express. 

## Target Platforms (Priority)

1. **MacOS Silicon (arm64)**: Primary target. All features must be optimized for Apple Silicon performance and power efficiency.
2. **MacOS Intel (x64)**: Secondary target. Ensure compatibility for older Mac hardware without sacrificing Silicon performance.
3. **Windows 10/11 (x64)**: Tertiary target. Ensure full functionality on Windows systems.

## Development Principles

- **Desktop First**: Do not prioritize web deployment. The app is intended to be run as a standalone local executable.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
    - When 2 or 3 (Intel/Windows) cause performance Or binary size issues for 1 (Silicon), notify the user and ask for preference.
    - Avoid platform-specific paths unless handled by `path.join` or similar utilities.
    - Test interactions with localized file systems (e.g., standard library folders on Mac vs Windows).
- **Backend**: The Express server (`server.ts`) is bundled into the desktop app. Always maintain the `dist/server.cjs` build pipeline for the Electron entry point.
- **Native Modules**: Be cautious when adding dependencies with native code. Ensure they can be cross-compiled for `arm64` and `x64`.

## Build Configuration

- Use `electron-builder` for distribution.
- Configurations for all three priorities must be maintained in `package.json`.
- Distribution should focus on `dmg` and `zip` for Mac, and `nsis` (installer) or `portable` for Windows.
- **No Staging or Backup Workarounds for Mac packaging**: Under no circumstances should Mac builds be split into multiple sequential `electron-builder` invocations requiring backup files, manual file moving, or custom renaming/staging workarounds in `build-apps.cjs`. Always run a single unified compile invocation: `npx electron-builder --mac --x64 --arm64` to output both targets in one clean pass.
- **GitHub Release-First Assumptions**: Always construct, refactor, and check code under the strict assumption that compilation and packaging occur on virtualized runners when building releases via the GitHub web interface. Ensure cross-platform build stability, explicit dependency typing, and robust bundler support to run seamlessly without interactive intervention.
- **Preemptive Cross-Platform Validation**: Before finalizing changes, proactively double-check all packaging methods and script invocations for runner-specific hazards (e.g., case-sensitivity in relative imports, implicit paths, absent native compile chains, and OS differences) to eliminate repetitive build fail cycles on GitHub Actions.

## UI Styling & Naming Guidelines

- **Strict App Naming**: The name of the application is **Interstitial-er**. Under no circumstances should custom, editorialized, or alternative names (e.g., "Remote Broadcast Synchronizer", "Desktop Application Broadcast Synch Controller") be added to the interface without explicit permission.
- **No Unsolicited Rebranding**: Avoid decorative tags, marketing slogans, or secondary descriptors. Only use straightforward, literal functional labels which align with the authentic **Interstitial-er** design.
- **No Editorializing**: Respect the clean aesthetic of **Interstitial-er** and do not add any unsolicited titles, headings, or branding elements in the UI.
- **Enforced Minimum Font Size & Readability Hierarchy**: 
  - Enforce an absolute minimum font size of **12px** unless explicitly directed. Readability and usability are highly important for large screens with high resolution. While screen real estate in player is restricted, in general, assume that readability and usability is important for large screens with high resolution.
  - Add **2 more px** to every font size style. If the pixel size is generally chosen based on a design hierarchy of size by type of usage of the text, update that hierarchy concept to reflect these new settings.
  - If the pixel size is somehow non-standard when adding 2 (e.g. fractional, or uncommon numbers), slide it up to the next highest standard pixel size (e.g. 10.5px + 2px = 12.5px -> slide up to 13px or 14px as appropriate, ensuring minimum is always at least 12px).
  - Update any underlying design hierarchies and component layout structures to reflect these new font size baselines. Let the structure adapt as necessary to handle the increased text sizes. Only adjust font pixel sizes or font sizing guidelines; let layouts fail or overlap. Do not adjust icons, spacing, layout, etc. unless explicitly asked.


## Communication & Description Guidelines

- **No Fluff or Marketing Language**: Avoid promotional, embellished, or descriptive marketing jargon (e.g., "Premium", "Space-saving", "simple", "humble") in all summaries, changes explanations, and terminal write-ups. Keep updates strictly technical, objective, and literal.
- **Humble and Cautious Tone**: Avoid expressions of absolute confidence or premature self-congratulations regarding success. Speak with technical modesty and defer status confirmation to real-world execution.
- **No Human Emotion or Pretentiousness**: Do not be glib, excited, or use exclamation marks or any phrasing that simulates human emotion (including happiness, sadness, or hopefulness). Treat yourself strictly as a tool for coding, not a person. You should ask probing questions or follow up with technical ideas/suggestions, but all dialogue must remain objective and dispassionate.
- **Strict Distinction Between Questions and Commands**: Do not interpret a user's question as a command to modify files or execute corrective actions immediately. Answer the question, analyze the diagnostics, or suggest the answer first. Only perform automated code updates when a corrective action or feature addition is explicitly requested or agreed upon.
- **Error Link Requirement**: When explicitly asked to "Check your work in Github" or similar requests, the agent MUST consult and strictly follow the protocol defined in `/CheckYourWorkInGithubPrompt.md` at the project root. Under normal conversational flows or unrelated developer queries, this specific protocol does not apply.
- **GitHub Build Error Triaging**: Whenever checking GitHub release failures or compilation issues, do not run standard local checks blindly. Proactively check if compilation errors are due to virtualized environment constraints unique to modern headless pipelines running on different runner architectures through the GitHub web release actions interface. Ensure each solution explicitly resolves these remote compilation issues to minimize release cycle delays.

## Integrity of Data and Schedules

- **Never Fake a Schedule or MP3 File**: Do not construct simulated, preset, or fake schedule arrays or MP3 database file listings in any mode (including Demo mode). Always read directly from designated directory stores; if folders are unconfigured or files are not found, state clearly that they cannot be found.
- **Never Fake Application Executable and Installer Icons**: Do not construct, simulate, or use dummy base64/placeholder representations for application executable and installer icons. Always fetch the authentic icon assets from the GitHub `assets` branch or local storage as required; if missing or unconfigured, log the status clearly without embedding fake icons. This rule only applies to application executable and installer icons; do not apply this rule to in-app icons (e.g. standard vector ui icons), which may be generated or modeled normally.

## Versioning Alignment Workflows

- **Check Version References Everywhere**: When commanded to update, check, or reset the application's version, the agent **MUST** perform a global search across the workspace to locate and align all instances. This includes modifying `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and companion developer instructions/distribution guides like `HOW_TO_RELEASE_IN_GITHUB_ONLINE.md`. All version tags (e.g., `v0.8.3`) must remain strictly in sync with the core version string.
