# Step-by-Step GitHub Web-Only Release Guide

This guide outlines how to trigger the automated build of desktop installer binaries (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.zip`) and attach them to a release on GitHub—**using only your web browser**.

By drafting the release page on the website first, you register the version and title in a draft state, making sure everything is perfectly staged before triggers run.

*(Note: We have updated the workspace configuration to execute .NET MAUI compilation and packaging directly during tag workflows. When GitHub Actions compiles your code, the .NET SDK and MAUI workloads builds are package-constructed and uploaded directly to your published live release).*

## Step 1: Export Current App Code from AI Studio to GitHub

Make sure all changes made inside the AI Studio sandbox (including our update to version `0.1.3` in `package.json`) are exported to your GitHub repository.

1. Locate and click on the **Settings** gear icon in the AI Studio workspace sidebar.
2. Select the **Export / Connect to GitHub** option from the panels.
3. Authenticate with your GitHub credentials if prompted.
4. Select your repository: `JON99999/Interstitial-er`.
5. Click the button to export/push files to your **`main`** branch. This updates the remote repository to version `0.1.3`.

**⚠️ Final Reminder**: Manually upload your local high-resolution application icon files directly to <a href="https://github.com/JON99999/Interstitial-er/upload/main/src/assets/images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GitHub images folder</a> if you have made offline modifications to the launcher icons.

## Step 2: Create and Stage the Draft Release on GitHub Web

Creating a draft release prepares the target version tag and coordinates ahead of time.

1. Open your web browser and navigate to <a href="https://github.com/JON99999/Interstitial-er" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your GitHub repository (JON99999/Interstitial-er)</a>.
2. In the right sidebar, click on **Releases** (or click the **Draft a new release** button if visible).
3. Click the **Draft a new release** button.
4. Click the box labeled **Choose a tag**:
   - Type in **`v0.1.3`** *(make sure it starts with a lowercase "v" and matches the exact version in `package.json`)*.
   - Click the blue option that appears below it: **Create new tag: v0.1.3 on publish**.
5. Keep the **Target** dropdown set to **`main`**.
6. Enter a Title (e.g., `v0.1.3 Release`) and write any high-level notes in the description area.
7. Scroll to the bottom of the page:
   - **CRITICAL**: Do **NOT** select the checkbox "Set as a pre-release". 
   - **CRITICAL**: Do **NOT** click the green "Publish release" button yet.
   - Instead, click the grey button labeled **Save draft**.

## Step 3: Trigger the Build by Publishing the Release

Now you will publish the release, which instantly instructs GitHub to create the `v0.1.3` tag on your repository. This tag push is what triggers GitHub Actions to compile the applications.

1. While still on your Draft Release page, click the **Edit** button (or <a href="https://github.com/JON99999/Interstitial-er/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go to your Releases page on GitHub</a>, find your draft, and click edit).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the green **Publish release** button.
3. This creates the official tag on GitHub and fires up the compile machinery!

## Step 4: Monitor and Confirm the Installer Files

1. Go immediately to the <a href="https://github.com/JON99999/Interstitial-er/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions Dashboard</a> to watch your workflow progress.
2. You will see a newly running workflow called **Build/Release .NET MAUI App** triggered by your new tag `v0.1.3`.
3. Wait for the two runner environments (`windows-latest` and `macos-latest`) to complete compiling both the **Player** and **Admin** packages (usually takes 3–5 minutes).
4. Once completed, <a href="https://github.com/JON99999/Interstitial-er/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">return to your live Releases page on GitHub</a>. The packaged installer files (`.dmg`, `.exe`, `.zip`) will now be neatly listed as download attachments under the `v0.1.3` assets foldout list!
